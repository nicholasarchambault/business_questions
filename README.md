# Analyzing Business Data and Questions with SQL

by Nicholas Archambault

This project seeks to answer business questions about customer purchases, employee performance, and inventory management by querying the Chinook database, a set of eleven tables of interconnected consumer and store data for a fictional digital music store.

## Goals

   1. Provide a recommendation for the genre types of new albums that should be added to the store, based current genre popularity.
   2. Evaluate relative employee performance among sales representatives.
   3. Examine sales by country in order to identify new opportunities for business growth.
   4. Advise on the implementation of new managerial policy which would purchase only the most popular tracks from albums, rather than every track.

## Output

Complex SQL queries which draw qualitative and quantitative conclusions about the stated goals.
