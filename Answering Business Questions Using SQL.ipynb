    "   * The company should purchase Pop, Punk, and Blues albums and be on the lookout for opportunities to purchase more Rock albums, as the Rock genre accounts for over half of all purchases.\n",
    "   * The company does most of its business in the United States, but new opportunities for growth could be present in Czech Republic, United Kingdom, and India.\n",
    "   * There is not an appreciable difference in the overall quality of sales employee performance.\n",
    "   * The company should refrain from changing its purchasing policy to one that buys only certain tracks from albums. Doing so risks losing ~20% of total revenue. "
